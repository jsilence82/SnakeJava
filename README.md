Snake Game in Java

I had already created a Snake Game in Python and this is an attempt at writing the same game in Java.

Score is based on how fast the snake eats the food. The speed of the snake also increases after each bite.

Some ideas for future updates/fixes:
- High score tracking
- Game difficulty setting (speed of snake, whether snake speed increases, etc)
- Graphic updates (icons for food and snake rather than geometric shapes)
